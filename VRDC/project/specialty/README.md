# Specialty-diagnosis analysis

This repository contains supplemental files. Files are named in style that mirrors the tables in the manuscript.

# File st4 - supplemental data for table 4

This file is most relevant to researchers authoring an executable phenotype. For each code used in their phenotype, they can review the "operating characteristics" in terms of which specialties contribute this diagnosis. The top contriuting diagnoses should not be missing from the dataset.  
For example, for diagnosis L40.0 Psoriasis vulgaris, the most important specialty is dermatology - 78.99% of events with that diagnoses come from a dermatologist.  
Further examples are in article where we describe multi specialty diagnoses and highly specialty specific diagnoses. L40.0 would meet the definion of highly specialty-specific diagnosis.  
This file is not as relevant for data quality assesment of a dataset. It is too detailed for that. For such assesment, simply the aggregation on specialty level or diagnosis level allows simpler comparison of given dataset to some reference data.
