# ETL into OMOP Common Data Model (Medicaid data)

Common Data Models (CDMs) allow portability of analysis. In order to execute analyses that assume the OMOP representation of data, we convert Medicaid data into OMOP model.

The data dictionary of the TMSIS Analytic Files (TAF) data format is availabe at https://www2.ccwdata.org/web/guest/data-dictionaries (scroll down to section Medicaid).  
 - E.g., TAF Claims columns: https://www2.ccwdata.org/documents/10280/19022436/record-layout-taf-claims.xlsx  Values explanation: https://www2.ccwdata.org/documents/10280/19022436/codebook-taf-claims.pdf
