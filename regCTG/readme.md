# Project history

We created a report for COVID-19 research that analyzed all COVID-19 interventional trials, observational studies and registries. Because this report was fully computerized and based on structured data from ClinicalTrials.gov registry, it was possible to generalize this to all diseases.

# Changes made to the general report compared to the COVID-19 specific report

COVID-19 report has time scopes (in weeks) that were most appropriate for an emerging diseases. In order to analyze all spectrum of diseases, we made some modifications to the report to allow analysis of diseases that have a long and more complex history of prior research.
